I will create a game that is based on rolling the dice and getting as high score as possible. Idea is to throw five dice, each player on its own turn, and get highest score for each fitting category. Player with highest total score wins.

Single-player against AI and local multiplayer will be implented. Game will also have some sort of high score list for keeping track of the best performances.


**Users:** Player 

## Player's actions:
* playing against either AI or human
* checking the high score list
